Fast food is very popular in the foreign countries, 
so many children have the problem of obesity. But 
nearly every kid like to eat fast food, because it 
smells really good. But it is known to all that fast 
food is not good for people¡¯s health. Eating it for a 
long time will make them lose nutrition and become fat. 
So we¡¯d better stay away from fast food, or if we like 
it so much, we should not eat it often.
